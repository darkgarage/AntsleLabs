## 🧐About

I wanted a repeatable way to build-out testing environments, for script development along with testing of potentially destructive ssytem changes.


## 💡Features

1. Mutilple possible lab configurations
2. Built to utilize the Antsle One hypervisor appliance


## ⛏️Built with

-   Antsle
-   Terraform


## 🏁Getting Started

More to come...


<!-- ## 📚Prerequisite

-   Antsle Appliance
-   Terraform VM

### 🧰Installation

Step by step methods to guide the reader how to setup local dev environment for eg:

1. Clone this repo
1. Install all the dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

1. Tweak the code
1. Run on local server

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

## 🚀Deployment

List all the steps to deploy the local copy of the project and make it live for eg:

1. Create a new repo
1. Push your code to it
1. Create New Project on your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
1. Import your Git Repository
1. After successful import, changes made to the Production Branch (commonly "main/master") will be a Production Deployment and rest all branches will generate Preview Deployments.
1. Once deployed, you will get a URL for your live app, such as: `https://xyz.vercel.app` -->

## 📝Todo

-   Create Windows Domain environment build plan
-   Create Destroy process for easy environment teardown
-   Create CIOT SCADA environment build plan


## 📈Future Plans

-   Simplify the build process, so user can easily expand or shrink the end environment
-   Create GUI for selection of desired environment components
